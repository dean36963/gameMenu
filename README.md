gameMenu
========

A menu controlled a gamepad to launch games!


This is a really basic program that you can configure to launch games from. The interface is controlled entirely with a gamepad.

You can add things to the menu be editing 'gameMenu.csv'. The current format of this file is:
  Title,Command
This will change to accomodate for icons.
  
The menu is currently hardcoded to use an xbox controller. Added functionality to define which buttons to use, and hence the ability to use other gamepads will be added soon.
